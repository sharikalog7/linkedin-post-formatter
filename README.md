## Secrets & API Keys
This project does not commit any secrets like API keys to the repository.
To safely manage your OpenAI API key (or any other secrets):

Use .streamlit/secrets.toml locally (make sure it is added to .gitignore).

Use environment variables or secret managers in production.

Never commit .streamlit/secrets.toml or any secret file to git history.

## Removing Secrets from Git History
If you accidentally committed secrets, use the following steps to completely remove them:


   pip install git-filter-repo
   git filter-repo --path .streamlit/secrets.toml --invert-paths
   git push origin main --force


## Then revoke your exposed keys immediately.
